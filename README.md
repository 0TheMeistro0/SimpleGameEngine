SimpleGameEngine
================

Simple and easy to use game engine written in C++

Designed with the following principles in mind:

* Easy to use
* Follows Object Oriented design principles
* Cross platform
* Very little boilerplate code


There is a sample project for this [here](https://github.com/C0deH4cker/Ballz).
Also, there is a [Flappy Bird clone](https://github.com/C0deH4cker/FlappingBird) too!


###TODO:

* Add a SpriteBatch class to make rendering textures faster
* Allow drawing text
